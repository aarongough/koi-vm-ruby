= Koi

Koi is an extremely simple Virtual Machine written in Ruby. It was created with learning in mind and is written so that it is easy to understand and play with.

=== Examples

The standard 'Hello world!', Koi style:
  
  require 'koi'
  include Koi
  
  VM.new.run [
    PUSH, "Hello World!",
    PRINT
  ]
  
  #=> Hello world!
  
And an old-school 'Blast off' example:

  require 'koi'
  include Koi

  VM.new.run [
    PUSH, 11,
    PUSH, 1,
    SUBTRACT,
    DUP,
    PRINT,
    DUP, 
    JUMP_IF, -6,
    PUSH, "Blast off!",
    PRINT
  ]
